The score breaks down into four different aspects, each being negative, neutral, positive and compound. Here is a breakdown of what each of them mean:\n",

    "Great! With our trained classifier ready, we have the capability to evaluate new reviews. The function `predict_sentiment` was crafted to convert any given text into a numerical format akin to the transformation applied to our training dataset. This numerical data is then presented to the trained classifier, which yields a sentiment prediction. From the example provided, the classifier was presented with an upbeat movie review, and it accurately returned the sentiment as positive.\n",

    "It can’t capture the meaning of phrases as a whole, which can lead to incorrect classifications at times as well. So, don't be surprised if you put in some inputs and it generates a wrong outcome. Ultimately it's trained on 2000 words (1000 pos and 1000 neg), so a much larger dataset is needed for a greater level of accuracy. Therefore, understanding and improving upon these errors is a key part of the machine-learning process."
