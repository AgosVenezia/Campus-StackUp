# GraphQL With Etherscan APIs

## Recap of Bounty
Based on the GraphQL with REST API module, you have learnt how to wrap multiple REST API endpoints into a single GraphQL API for more efficient querying. 

In the previous bounty, you have wrapped multiple etherscan API endpoints under a GraphQL API. In this quest, we will be expanding on the functionalities of the GraphQL API to track the key metrics of the Ethereum network

- Get Ether Balance for a Single Address (https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts#get-ether-balance-for-a-single-address)
- Get Total Supply of Ether (https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/stats-1#get-total-supply-of-ether) 

## Getting Started
1. Sign up for a new Etherscan account to generate your API key if you do not have one. 
2. Proceed to clone the git repository 
3. Create a new .env file and create a `ETHERSCAN_API` key variable to insert your Etherscan API key value
4. Run the `$npm install` command to install the necessary dependencies
5. Run the `$node index.js` command to initialise the GraphQL server and run your queries
