# authController.js

This file contains code that gives admin role, gives user role, loads admin page, load user page and finally, logout the current user by clearing the session cookie + jwt.

Most of the code is self-explanatory. If you have some questions, please ask away at [StackUp Discord](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1060491074109456454) if you find things confusing!
