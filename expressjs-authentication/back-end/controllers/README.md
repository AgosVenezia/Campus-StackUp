# authController.js

The `authController.js` file is in the controller directory. This is where
the data is processed when the user is redirected after submitting their
credentials in the login modal or registration modal.

The `authController.js` file also cleans up the login
data after logging out.

For already logged in (or more accurately, authenticated) users, the
`authController.js` file allows user operations such as

- loading their user profile; and
- updating their user profile
