What is Learn &amp; Earns Reward Mechanism? Since Learn &amp; Earn started, we have always rewarded players on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that the fastest players to submit a quest receive rewards. In response to user feedback highlighting the challenge of earning rewards and the pressure to quickly complete quests, Learn &amp; Earn is trying out a new reward distribution system. This change is intended to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to earn rewards for their effort and hard work, even if they may not be able to participate right away when a quest launches. We want to continue rewarding our very dedicated players who are there at 1200 hrs GMT+8 to start questing, so a portion of the rewards will be reserved for the fastest players. The remaining rewards will be distributed via the new mechanism. For all quests included in this experimental reward mechanism, it will be stated explicitly in the quests introduction. How it works? Example 1: Random Allocation Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, and 2000 players submit their entries. 1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. The remaining 500 rewards are randomly distributed among the 1000 approved players who weren't the fastest to submit. Each of these remaining players has a 50% chance of receiving a reward. Example 2: Even Distribution Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, totalling a prize pool of $1500. 2000 players have submitted their entries.1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. After distributing $1000 to the fastest players, $500 remains in the prize pool. This remaining amount is then evenly divided among the remaining 1000 approved players who have not received a reward yet. Consequently, each of these players will receive 50 cents.  FAQs  1.How will I know if I am one of the fastest players to receive a reward?Your quest status will be rewarded and you can also view your reward in your list of transactions on the "Balance &amp; Request History" page found under "My Balance". 2. How is the random allocation conducted?We will use a seed for a random number generator (RNG). The RNG will then generate a list of numbers which will correspond to a players submission number. 3. How will I know if I have been rewarded in the random allocation mechanism?As this mechanism is still in the experimental stage, users who are rewarded via the new mechanism will see the approved status. However, you can view transactions on the "Balance &amp; Request History" page found under "My Balance". If you are rewarded, you will see your reward for the quest as a transaction. 4. How can I provide feedback on the new reward mechanism? You can visit our Discord server and head to the [[ideas-and-feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/895572257466875924)] channel to share your thoughts.Disclaimer: This initiative is currently in the experimental phase, with potential changes to how it works. It will undergo limited testing for a while and its future implementation is still uncertain. Any updates will be communicated clearly.


Email Address UpdateThe update of email addresses will be handled on a case-by-case basis, subject to specific criteria that must be met before the process can commence. You can submit a [ticket](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9094359542041) for assistance. You may request an email address change if your situation aligns with the following criteria:- You are using your school or university's email address, and you are about to lose access to it.- You are using your work email address, and you are about to lose access to it.However, your request will be rejected if any of the following criteria apply:- You have received a warning email from StackUp regarding suspicious activity observed on your account.- You have received an email indicating that you have shared payment details with other users.- Your account is associated with a suspended account.- Your account is already suspended from the platform.Username Update We regret to inform you that username updates are currently unavailable due to potential complications this feature may entail.

Step 2 - Ensure that your wallet can receive tokens on the C-chain. Open your wallet and navigate to the section displaying your wallet addresses. Locate the C-chain address, which begins with "0x".The example shown below is using the CORE wallet. Step 3 - After obtaining your public address on the C-chain, go to the [StackUp Earn page](https://earn.stackup.dev/). Click the menu icon at the top right of your screen and select "My Balance." Then, choose "Manage Account" and click "Add Crypto Wallet" to add a new wallet, or click the pencil icon to edit an existing wallet address. Finally, click "Save".

To ensure StackUp complies with all applicable laws and regulations, we are updating the list of countries supported by our platform, effective from November 9, 2022. Unfortunately, we will no longer be able to support Stackies residing in or citizens of the following regions/countries:  Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea) Republic of Sudan Russia Islamic Republic of Iran Republic of Cuba Ukraine Syrian Arab Republic State of Libya Federal Republic of Somalia Republic of Yemen Democratic Republic of the Congo  Why are these countries not supported? StackUp, along with our campaign partners and payment providers, must adhere to legal obligations. Upon review, we have determined that supporting Stackies from these countries is restricted by applicable laws. This includes challenges in awarding quest rewards and processing payments through our payment providers. Despite our best efforts, we regret that we are unable to facilitate rewards for Stackies in these countries. Additionally, due to system limitations and complexities, residents of the following countries may also face challenges joining our platform:  Afghanistan Pakistan Palestinian Territory Iraq  We appreciate your understanding as we work to uphold legal compliance while striving to support as many Stackies as possible.


StackUp currently supports two payment methods. a. WISE (Through WISE tag/ Email Address)     StackUp uses WISE to pay out our stackies who wish to receive their rewards in local currency (FIAT). These payouts can be obtained in your WISE balance or directly transferred to the bank account you have set as the primary receiver on WISE.            b. USDC stablecoin (cryptocurrency) via AVAX network StackUp sends USDC and it maintains a 1:1 ratio with USD. So the amount of USD withdrawn = the amount of USDC received. Important: Some payment methods may not be supported in all countries.

Why We Require Your Full Name and Last 4 Digits of Your Account Number on WISE:  The Wise platform operates independently from StackUp, making it essential for us to ensure that rewards are sent to the correct account. Providing your full name and the last four digits of your account number (or UPI ID for Indian users only) helps us verify this information accurately.  What happens if I don't provide all the required information on WISE through the StackUp platform?  This may result in a delayed payment issuance.  As an existing Stackie using WISE to receive my rewards, how will these two additional pieces of information affect my withdrawal process?  For your next withdrawal, you will need to provide your full name and the last four digits of your account number (or UPI ID for Indian users only) before submitting your withdrawal request.  As a new user utilizing the WISE payment option to receive my rewards, how will this impact me?  After creating an account on WISE, head to your StackUp profile and fill in the WISE details needed such as the WISE Email, Wisetag, Full name, and the last four digits of your account number (or UPI ID for Indian users only)How to Update Your WISE Details as an Existing Stackie Using WISE to Receive RewardsStep 1: Click on "Request Withdrawal"Step 2: Select WISE as your withdrawal method.Step 3: Fill out the fields necessary fieldsStep 4: Double-check that you've entered your correct WISE information without a typo.
